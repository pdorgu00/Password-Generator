This is a password generator I created that takes characters,special characters,numbers from 8 to 128 characters.I started my assignment by creating a navbar from Bootstrap. I had to make it take up the whole 12 columns. Then I added a jumbotron and a text input area for the password. You can keep clicking the generate button password button to change the current one. There is a also a copy button which will copy the password to the clipboard.I used stack overflow to help me with the syntax for the event listeners.
